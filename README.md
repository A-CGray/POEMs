OpenMDAO Poetry 
===============
 
The Poetry process is the official mechanism for proposing, discussing, revising, and ultimately approving or rejecting all changes to the [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org) project which effect its user interaction. 
Poetry governs all API changes, feature additions, and feature removals to the OpenMDAO project. 
Poetry is also recursive, because it also governs any changes to the Poetry process itself. 

The rules and process of poetry are described in the [POEM_000.md](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Poetry/blob/master/poem_000.md) file in this repository. 

The OpenMDAO poetry repository (i.e. this repo) contains a full record of all POEMS submitted, starting November 1st, 2019. 

The Poetry process
--------------------------
Poetry is intended to serve two primary and equally important purposes: 

    1) Announce all changes to the user interface of OpenMDAO to users  
    of the framework **before** they are added to the main repository
    
    2) Provide a mechanism for external users to propose changes to the   
    user interface for OpenMDAO

Poetry involves writing, reading, and discussing POEMS (**p**roposal for **O**penMDAO **e**nhance**m**ent). 
Both the core development team and external users participate, and input on any POEM is welcome from any user at any time. 

Note
----
**Actual poetry is encouraged** in all OpenMDAO POEM documents
