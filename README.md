OpenMDAO Poetry 
===============

The Poetry process is the official mechanism for proposing, discussing, revising, and ultimately approving or rejecting all changes to the OpenMDAO project which effect its user interaction. 
Poetry governs all API changes, feature additions, and feature removals to the OpenMDAO project. 
Poetry is also recursive, because it also governs any changes to the Poetry process itself. 

The rules and process of poetry are described in the POEM_000.md file in this repository. 


Note
----
**Actual poetry is encouraged** in all OpenMDAO POEMs
