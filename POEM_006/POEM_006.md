Motivation
==========
Lack enough ways to select and do things with systems.

Allow for growth.

Buttons are not obvious to users

Screen real estate.


Description
===========

Mockups

if we can have a prototype of our the new UI, then thats probably a good place to start
we had decided on a hybrid approach. A tool-bar for choose the mode for the left-click and double-click. ( like Photoshop)
Then a right-click menu that holds functionality (edited)

what kind of functionality?  "info" is one (size, value, units, etc). "Collapse/expand" is another (edited)

More space for legend.

Better buttons.

Currently:

- left click zooms into a system
- right click collapses
-

Put toolbar on the left.

Having the toolbar/header remain on the top but “stick” so that when you scroll on the
page, the bar is always present.

Use card sorting for team members who work on this project.
Include each icon from the toolbar and have each user label what they believe the icon
does.
This is a tool to recognize the effectiveness of the current icons/tool bar to promote
new changes.
They can then be recategorized and tools that aren’t used can be eliminated.


The mockup we did for the workshop had

- 3 different Modes: collapse mode, zoom mode, tooltip mode

It looked like this:

Right click offers Collapse, and Edit File, as examples.
